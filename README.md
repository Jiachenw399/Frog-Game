# Frog-Game
## Game Description
Frogger is a classic arcade game where the player guides a number of frogs across a busy road and then a river
until they get to their homes. There are typically 5 frogs, which means there are 5 homes for the frogs at the
other side of the river. Each home can only fit a single frog, so while the first frog can get to any of the homes
the last frog only has a single option for where to go.
The player only passes the level after there is a frog in each one of the homes on the other side of the river.
## Crossing The Road
The frog moves in jumps every time a direction key is pressed. There are multiple lanes on the road and all of
the cars in the same lane travel at the same speed and in the same direction. If the frog is hit by one of the
cars on the road then the player loses a life and restarts with the frog at the bottom of the screen as long as
they have a remaining life. There is a safe space after the road and before the river where the frog is safe.
## Crossing The River
The frog dies if it enters the water of the river. In the river there are logs that all float in the same direction,
but may be moving at different speeds. Like the cars on the road, logs that are in the same lane of the river all
travel at the same speed. There are also some turtles that swim in the opposite direction to the logs. Again,
turtles in the same lane travel at the same speed, but may travel different speeds in other lanes.
The frog can jump onto the back of the frogs or onto the logs, but when it does so it is carried in the same
direction at the same speed. If the log or turtle carries the frog so that it touches the edge of the screen then
the frog dies and is forced to restart at the bottom of the screen.

You can use the arrows on your keyboard to control the frog.
